## 🌊 The Problem: "Data Fragmentation" 🧩
Recruiters today waste **30% of their day** jumping between LinkedIn, Internal ATS, and Job Portals. 
* ❌ **Duplicate Profiles:** Wasting time on candidates already in the system.
* ❌ **Data Conflicts:** LinkedIn says "Manager," ATS says "Senior Lead"—which is true?
* ❌ **Inefficiency:** Slower hiring decisions due to "Tab-Switching Fatigue."

## 💡 The Big Idea: "One Profile, One Truth" 💎
**TalentStream AI** is an intelligent dashboard that pulls data from multiple silos and merges them into a **Single Actionable Candidate Card**. No more switching tabs. No more conflicting data.

### 📊 3. Visual Talent Analytics
Integrated **Chart.js** analytics show you exactly where your talent is coming from. Data-driven recruiting at its best!

### ⚡ 4. High-Performance UI
